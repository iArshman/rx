## Updating Your Code

After making code changes:

1. Stop the running service:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

2. Run setup again (it will rebuild):
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./install.sh
   ```

Or rebuild and restart manually:
```bash
docker build -t coolify:latest .
docker compose up -d
```

```bash
COOLIFY_APP_ID=your-unique-id

COOLIFY_LOG_LEVEL=info
TAG=latest
```

## Troubleshooting

**Port 3000 already in use?**
```bash
# Change port in docker-compose.yaml
# Find the line:  published: 3000
# Change to:      published: 8080  (or any other port)
# Then restart: docker compose restart
```

**Database errors?**
```bash
# Reset the database
docker volume rm coolify-db
docker compose restart
```

**Need to see full logs?**
```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100 -f coolify
```
